      	<span>What can I give thee back, O liberal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And princely giver, who hast brought the gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laid them on the outside of the wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For such as I to take or leave withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In unexpected largesse? am I cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ungrateful, that for these most manifold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High gifts, I render nothing back at all?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not so; not cold⁠—but very poor instead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask God who knows. For frequent tears have run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The colours from my life, and left so dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To give the same as pillow to thy head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go farther! let it serve to trample on.</p>
