			<h2>VIII</h2>
			<p class="poetry">What can I give thee back, O liberal<br/> And princely giver, who hast brought the gold<br/> And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,<br/> And laid them on the outside of the wall<br/> For such as I to take or leave withal,<br/> In unexpected largesse? am I cold,<br/> Ungrateful, that for these most manifold<br/> High gifts, I render nothing back at all?<br/> Not so; not cold⁠—but very poor instead.<br/> Ask God who knows. For frequent tears have run<br/> The colours from my life, and left so dead<br/> And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done<br/> To give the same as pillow to thy head.<br/> Go farther! let it serve to trample on.</p>
