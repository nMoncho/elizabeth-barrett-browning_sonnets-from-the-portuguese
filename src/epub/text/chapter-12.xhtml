			<h2>XII</h2>
			<p class="poetry">Indeed this very love which is my boast,<br/> And which, when rising up from breast to brow,<br/> Doth crown me with a ruby large enow<br/> To draw men’s eyes and prove the inner cost⁠—<br/> This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,<br/> I should not love withal, unless that thou<br/> Hadst set me an example, shown me how,<br/> When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,<br/> And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak<br/> Of love even, as a good thing of my own:<br/> Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,<br/> And placed it by thee on a golden throne⁠—<br/> And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)<br/> Is by thee only, whom I love alone.</p>
