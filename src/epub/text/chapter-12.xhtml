      	<span>Indeed this very love which is my boast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And which, when rising up from breast to brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doth crown me with a ruby large enow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To draw men’s eyes and prove the inner cost⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should not love withal, unless that thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hadst set me an example, shown me how,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of love even, as a good thing of my own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And placed it by thee on a golden throne⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is by thee only, whom I love alone.</p>
