			<h2>XXXVIII</h2>
			<p class="poetry">First time he kissed me, he but only kissed<br/> The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;<br/> And ever since, it grew more clean and white.<br/> Slow to world-greetings, quick with its “Oh, list,”<br/> When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst<br/> I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,<br/> Than that first kiss. The second passed in height<br/> The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,<br/> Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed!<br/> That was the chrism of love, which love’s own crown,<br/> With sanctifying sweetness, did precede<br/> The third upon my lips was folded down<br/> In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,<br/> I have been proud and said, “My love, my own.”</p>
