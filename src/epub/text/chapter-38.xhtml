      	<span>First time he kissed me, he but only kissed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fingers of this hand wherewith I write,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever since, it grew more clean and white,⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slow to world greetings, quick with its “Oh, list,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than that first kiss. The second passed in height</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was the chrism of love, which love’s own crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sanctifying sweetness, did precede</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The third upon my lips was folded down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have been proud and said: “My love, my own.”</p>
