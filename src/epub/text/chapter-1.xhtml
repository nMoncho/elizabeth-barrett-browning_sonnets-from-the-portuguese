      	<span>I thought once how Theocritus had sung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who each one in a gracious hand appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those of my own life, who by turns had flung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A shadow across me. Straightway I was ’ware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a voice said in mastery, while I strove⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Guess now who holds thee!”⁠—“Death,” I said, But, there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silver answer rang, “Not Death, but Love.”</span>
