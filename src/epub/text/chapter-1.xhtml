			<h2>I</h2>
			<p class="poetry">I thought once how Theocritus had sung<br/> Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,<br/> Who each one in a gracious hand appears<br/> To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:<br/> And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,<br/> I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,<br/> The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,<br/> Those of my own life, who by turns had flung<br/> A shadow across me. Straightway I was ’ware,<br/> So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move<br/> Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;<br/> And a voice said in mastery, while I strove⁠—<br/> “Guess now who holds thee!”⁠—“Death,” I said, But, there,<br/> The silver answer rang, “Not Death, but Love.”</p>
