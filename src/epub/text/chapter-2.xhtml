      	<span>But only three in all God’s universe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have heard this word thou hast said⁠—Himself, beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One of us ⁠— <em>that</em> was God! — and laid the curse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My sight from seeing thee⁠—that if I had died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deathweights, placed there, would have signified</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Less absolute exclusion. “Nay” is worse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From God than from all others, O my friend!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men could not part us with their worldly jars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars,⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We should but vow the faster for the stars.</p>
