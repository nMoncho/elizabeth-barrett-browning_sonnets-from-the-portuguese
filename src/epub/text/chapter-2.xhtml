			<h2>II</h2>
			<p class="poetry">But only three in all God’s universe<br/> Have heard this word thou hast said⁠—Himself, beside<br/> Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied<br/> One of us … that was God, … and laid the curse<br/> So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce<br/> My sight from seeing thee⁠—that if I had died,<br/> The death-weights, placed there, would have signified<br/> Less absolute exclusion. “Nay” is worse<br/> From God than from all others, O my friend!<br/> Men could not part us with their worldly jars,<br/> Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;<br/> Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:<br/> And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,<br/> We should but vow the faster for the stars.</p>
