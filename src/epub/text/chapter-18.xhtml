			<h2>XVIII</h2>
			<p class="poetry">I never gave a lock of hair away<br/> To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,<br/> Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully<br/> I ring out to the full brown length and say<br/> “Take it.” My day of youth went yesterday;<br/> My hair no longer bounds to my foot’s glee,<br/> Nor plant I it from rose- or myrtle-tree,<br/> As girls do, any more: it only may<br/> Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,<br/> Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside<br/> Through sorrow’s trick. I thought the funeral-shears<br/> Would take this first, but Love is justified⁠—<br/> Take it thou⁠—finding pure, from all those years,<br/> The kiss my mother left here when she died.</p>
