			<h2>XXXII</h2>
			<p class="poetry">The first time that the sun rose on thine oath<br/> To love me, I looked forward to the moon<br/> To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon<br/> And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.<br/> Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;<br/> And, looking on myself, I seemed not one<br/> For such man’s love!⁠—more like an out-of-tune<br/> Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth<br/> To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,<br/> Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.<br/> I did not wrong myself so, but I placed<br/> A wrong on thee. For perfect strains may float<br/> ’Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced⁠—<br/> And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.</p>
