			<p>
      	<span>The first time that the sun rose on thine oath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To love me, I looked forward to the moon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, looking on myself, I seemed not one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For such man’s love!⁠—more like an out-of-tune</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I did not wrong myself so, but I placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wrong on <em>thee</em>. For perfect strains may float</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.</p>
