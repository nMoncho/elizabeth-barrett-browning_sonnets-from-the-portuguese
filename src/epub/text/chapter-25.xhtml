			<h2>XXV</h2>
			<p class="poetry">A heavy heart, Belovëd, have I borne<br/> From year to year until I saw thy face,<br/> And sorrow after sorrow took the place<br/> Of all those natural joys as lightly worn<br/> As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn<br/> By a beating heart at dance-time. Hopes apace<br/> Were changed to long despairs, till God’s own grace<br/> Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn<br/> My heavy heart. Then thou didst bid me bring<br/> And let it drop adown thy calmly great<br/> Deep being! Fast it sinketh, as a thing<br/> Which its own nature does precipitate,<br/> While thine doth close above it, mediating<br/> Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.</p>
