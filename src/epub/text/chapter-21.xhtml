			<h2>XXI</h2>
			<p class="poetry">Say over again, and yet once over again,<br/> That thou dost love me. Though the word repeated<br/> Should seem a “cuckoo-song,” as thou dost treat it,<br/> Remember, never to the hill or plain,<br/> Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain<br/> Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.<br/> Belovëd, I, amid the darkness greeted<br/> By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt’s pain<br/> Cry, “Speak once more⁠—thou lovest!” Who can fear<br/> Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,<br/> Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?<br/> Say thou dost love me, love me, love me⁠—toll<br/> The silver iterance!⁠—only minding, Dear,<br/> To love me also in silence with thy soul.</p>
