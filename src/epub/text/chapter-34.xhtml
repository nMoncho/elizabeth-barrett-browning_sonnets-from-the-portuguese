			<h2>XXXIV</h2>
			<p class="poetry">With the same heart, I said, I’ll answer thee<br/> As those, when thou shalt call me by my name⁠—<br/> Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,<br/> Perplexed and ruffled by life’s strategy?<br/> When called before, I told how hastily<br/> I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.<br/> To run and answer with the smile that came<br/> At play last moment, and went on with me<br/> Through my obedience. When I answer now,<br/> I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;<br/> Yet still my heart goes to thee⁠—ponder how⁠—<br/> Not as to a single good, but all my good!<br/> Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow<br/> That no child’s foot could run fast as this blood.</p>
