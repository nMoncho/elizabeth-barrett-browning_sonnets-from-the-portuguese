			<p class="poetry">My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!<br/> And yet they seem alive and quivering<br/> Against my tremulous hands which loose the string<br/> And let them drop down on my knee to-night.<br/> This said⁠—he wished to have me in his sight<br/> Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring<br/> To come and touch my hand … a simple thing,<br/> Yet I wept for it!⁠—this, … the paper’s light … <br/> Said, Dear I love thee; and I sank and quailed<br/> As if God’s future thundered on my past.<br/> This said, I am thine⁠—and so its ink has paled<br/> With lying at my heart that beat too fast.<br/> And this … O Love, thy words have ill availed<br/> If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!</p>
