			<h2>XXXVII</h2>
			<p class="poetry">Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make<br/> Of all that strong divineness which I know<br/> For thine and thee, an image only so<br/> Formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break.<br/> It is that distant years which did not take<br/> Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,<br/> Have forced my swimming brain to undergo<br/> Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake<br/> Thy purity of likeness and distort<br/> Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit.<br/> As if a shipwrecked Pagan, safe in port,<br/> His guardian sea-god to commemorate,<br/> Should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort<br/> And vibrant tail, within the temple-gate.</p>
