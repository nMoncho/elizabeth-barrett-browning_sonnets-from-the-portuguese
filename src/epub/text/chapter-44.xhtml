			<h2>XLIV</h2>
			<p class="poetry">Belovëd, thou hast brought me many flowers<br/> Plucked in the garden, all the summer through,<br/> And winter, and it seemed as if they grew<br/> In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.<br/> So, in the like name of that love of ours,<br/> Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,<br/> And which on warm and cold days I withdrew<br/> From my heart’s ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers<br/> Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,<br/> And wait thy weeding; yet here’s eglantine,<br/> Here’s ivy!⁠—take them, as I used to do<br/> Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.<br/> Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,<br/> And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine.</p>
