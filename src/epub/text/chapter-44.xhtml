      	<span>Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plucked in the garden, all the summer through</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And winter, and it seemed as if they grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, in the like name of that love of ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And which on warm and cold days I withdrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my heart’s ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wait thy weeding; yet here’s eglantine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here’s ivy!⁠—take them, as I used to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell thy soul their roots are left in mine.</p>
