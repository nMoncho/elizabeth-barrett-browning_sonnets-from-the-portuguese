			<h2>VII</h2>
			<p class="poetry">The face of all the world is changed, I think,<br/> Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul<br/> Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole<br/> Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink<br/> Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,<br/> Was caught up into love, and taught the whole<br/> Of life in a new rhythm. The cup of dole<br/> God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,<br/> And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.<br/> The names of country, heaven, are changed away<br/> For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;<br/> And this … this lute and song … loved yesterday,<br/> (The singing angels know) are only dear<br/> Because thy name moves right in what they say.</p>
