			<h2>XVII</h2>
			<p class="poetry">My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes<br/> God set between His After and Before,<br/> And strike up and strike off the general roar<br/> Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats<br/> In a serene air purely. Antidotes<br/> Of medicated music, answering for<br/> Mankind’s forlornest uses, thou canst pour<br/> From thence into their ears. God’s will devotes<br/> Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.<br/> How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?<br/> A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine<br/> Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?<br/> A shade, in which to sing⁠—of palm or pine?<br/> A grave, on which to rest from singing? Choose.</p>
