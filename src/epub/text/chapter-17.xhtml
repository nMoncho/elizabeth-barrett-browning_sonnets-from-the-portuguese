      	<span>My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God set between His After and Before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strike up and strike off the general roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a serene air purely. Antidotes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of medicated music, answering for</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mankind’s forlornest uses, thou canst pour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thence into their ears. God’s will devotes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A shade, in which to sing⁠—of palm or pine?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A grave, on which to rest from singing? Choose.</p>
