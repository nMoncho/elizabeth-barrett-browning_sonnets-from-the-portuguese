			<h2>XXX</h2>
			<p class="poetry">I see thine image through my tears to-night,<br/> And yet to-day I saw thee smiling. How<br/> Refer the cause?⁠—Belovëd, is it thou<br/> Or I, who makes me sad? The acolyte<br/> Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite<br/> May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,<br/> On the altar-stair. I hear thy voice and vow,<br/> Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,<br/> As he, in his swooning ears, the choir’s amen.<br/> Belovëd, dost thou love? or did I see all<br/> The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when<br/> Too vehement light dilated my ideal,<br/> For my soul’s eyes? Will that light come again,<br/> As now these tears come⁠—falling hot and real?</p>
