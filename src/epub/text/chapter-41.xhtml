			<h2>XLI</h2>
			<p class="poetry">I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,<br/> With thanks and love from mine. Deep thanks to all<br/> Who paused a little near the prison-wall<br/> To hear my music in its louder parts<br/> Ere they went onward, each one to the mart’s<br/> Or temple’s occupation, beyond call.<br/> But thou, who, in my voice’s sink and fall<br/> When the sob took it, thy divinest Art’s<br/> Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot<br/> To harken what I said between my tears, … <br/> Instruct me how to thank thee! Oh, to shoot<br/> My soul’s full meaning into future years,<br/> That they should lend it utterance, and salute<br/> Love that endures, from life that disappears!</p>
