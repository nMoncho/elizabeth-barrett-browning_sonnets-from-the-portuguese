      	<span>I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thanks and love from mine. Deep thanks to all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who paused a little near the prison-wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear my music in its louder parts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere they went onward, each one to the mart’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or temple’s occupation, beyond call.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou, who, in my voice’s sink and fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the sob took it, thy divinest Art’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To harken what I said between my tears, ⁠— </span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instruct me how to thank thee! Oh, to shoot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soul’s full meaning into future years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That <em>they</em> should lend it utterance, and salute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love that endures, from Life that disappears!</p>
