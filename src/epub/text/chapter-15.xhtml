			<h2>XV</h2>
			<p class="poetry">Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear<br/> Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;<br/> For we two look two ways, and cannot shine<br/> With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.<br/> On me thou lookest with no doubting care,<br/> As on a bee shut in a crystalline;<br/> Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love’s divine,<br/> And to spread wing and fly in the outer air<br/> Were most impossible failure, if I strove<br/> To fail so. But I look on thee⁠—on thee⁠—<br/> Beholding, besides love, the end of love,<br/> Hearing oblivion beyond memory;<br/> As one who sits and gazes from above,<br/> Over the rivers to the bitter sea.</p>
