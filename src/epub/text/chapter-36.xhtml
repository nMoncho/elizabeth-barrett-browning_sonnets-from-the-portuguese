      	<span>When we met first and loved, I did not build</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the event with marble. Could it mean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To last, a love set pendulous between</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorrow and sorrow? Nay, I rather thrilled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Distrusting every light that seemed to gild</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The onward path, and feared to overlean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A finger even. And, though I have grown serene</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strong since then, I think that God has willed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A still renewable fear ⁠— O love, O troth ⁠— </span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest these enclasped hands should never hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This mutual kiss drop down between us both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Love, be false! if <em>he</em>, to keep one oath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must lose one joy, by his life’s star foretold.</p>
