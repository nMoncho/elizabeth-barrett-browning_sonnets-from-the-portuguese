			<h2>XXXVI</h2>
			<p class="poetry">When we met first and loved, I did not build<br/> Upon the event with marble. Could it mean<br/> To last, a love set pendulous between<br/> Sorrow and sorrow? Nay, I rather thrilled,<br/> Distrusting every light that seemed to gild<br/> The onward path, and feared to overlean<br/> A finger even. And, though I have grown serene<br/> And strong since then, I think that God has willed<br/> A still renewable fear … O love, O troth … <br/> Lest these enclaspëd hands should never hold,<br/> This mutual kiss drop down between us both<br/> As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.<br/> And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,<br/> Must lose one joy, by his life’s star foretold.</p>
