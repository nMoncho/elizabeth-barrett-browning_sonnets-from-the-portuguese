			<h2>XXIV</h2>
			<p class="poetry">Let the world’s sharpness like a clasping knife<br/> Shut in upon itself and do no harm<br/> In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,<br/> And let us hear no sound of human strife<br/> After the click of the shutting. Life to life⁠—<br/> I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,<br/> And feel as safe as guarded by a charm<br/> Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife<br/> Are weak to injure. Very whitely still<br/> The lilies of our lives may reassure<br/> Their blossoms from their roots, accessible<br/> Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer;<br/> Growing straight, out of man’s reach, on the hill.<br/> God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.</p>
