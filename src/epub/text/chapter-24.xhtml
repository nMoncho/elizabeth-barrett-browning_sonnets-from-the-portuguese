			<p>
      	<span>Let the world’s sharpness like a clasping knife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shut in upon itself and do no harm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let us hear no sound of human strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After the click of the shutting. Life to life⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And feel as safe as guarded by a charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are weak to injure. Very whitely still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lilies of our lives may reassure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their blossoms from their roots, accessible</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Growing straight, out of man’s reach, on the hill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.</p>
