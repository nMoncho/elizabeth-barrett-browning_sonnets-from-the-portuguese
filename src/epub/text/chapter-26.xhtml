			<p>
      	<span>I lived with visions for my company</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instead of men and women, years ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sweeter music than they played to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soon their trailing purple was not free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of this world’s dust, their lutes did silent grow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I myself grew faint and blind below</span>
				<br/><!-- should `thou` be styled as `THOU`?? -->
				<span>Their vanishing eyes. Then thou didst come⁠—to <em>be</em>,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beloved, what they <em>seemed</em>. Their shining fronts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their songs, their splendours⁠ — better, yet the same,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As river-water hallowed into fonts⁠ —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Met in thee, and from out thee overcame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soul with satisfaction of all wants⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because God’s gifts put man’s best dreams to shame.</p>
