			<h2>XXVI</h2>
			<p class="poetry">I lived with visions for my company<br/> Instead of men and women, years ago,<br/> And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know<br/> A sweeter music than they played to me.<br/> But soon their trailing purple was not free<br/> Of this world’s dust, their lutes did silent grow,<br/> And I myself grew faint and blind below<br/> Their vanishing eyes. Then thou didst come⁠—to be,<br/> Belovëd, what they seemed. Their shining fronts,<br/> Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,<br/> As river-water hallowed into fonts)<br/> Met in thee, and from out thee overcame<br/> My soul with satisfaction of all wants:<br/> Because God’s gifts put man’s best dreams to shame.</p>
