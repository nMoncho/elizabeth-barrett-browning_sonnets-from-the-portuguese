      	<span>My own Beloved, who hast lifted me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shines out again, as all the angels see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before thy saving kiss! My own, my own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who camest to me when the world was gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I who looked for only God, found <em>thee</em>!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I find thee: I am safe, and strong, and glad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As one who stands in dewless asphodel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks backward on the tedious time he had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the upper life, ⁠—so I, with bosom-swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make witness, here, between the good and bad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well.</p>
