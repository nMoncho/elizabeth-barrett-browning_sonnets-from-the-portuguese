			<h2>XXVII</h2>
			<p class="poetry">My own Belovëd, who hast lifted me<br/> From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,<br/> And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown<br/> A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully<br/> Shines out again, as all the angels see,<br/> Before thy saving kiss! My own, my own,<br/> Who camest to me when the world was gone,<br/> And I who looked for only God, found thee!<br/> I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad.<br/> As one who stands in dewless asphodel,<br/> Looks backward on the tedious time he had<br/> In the upper life⁠—so I, with bosom-swell,<br/> Make witness, here, between the good and bad,<br/> That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well.</p>
