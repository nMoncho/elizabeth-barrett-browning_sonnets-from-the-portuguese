			<p>
      	<span>I think of thee!⁠—my thoughts do twine and bud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put out broad leaves, and soon there’s nought to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except the straggling green which hides the wood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not have my thoughts instead of thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who art dearer, better! Rather, instantly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drop heavily down,⁠—burst, shattered, everywhere!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And breathe within thy shadow a new air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I do not think of thee⁠—I am too near thee.</p>
